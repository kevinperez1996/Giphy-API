# Giphy-API
In this project, We have a website that displays varous different animal names inside of buttons. When the user clicks on a button, we do an ajax call and display 10 Gif images from the Giphy API. Once the images are displayed the user will notice that they are paused. In order to play the gif images the user must click on the image. The user also has a text box and "add button". This allows the user to add any additional animal to the list of button. Afdter adding a new animal (Or whatever the user wishes to add), a new button will be dynamically created, with which the user can then interact with.
